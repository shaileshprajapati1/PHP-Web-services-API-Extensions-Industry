        <h3>What is API?</h3>
        <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.</p>


        <h3>API benefits?</h3>
        <p>APIs simplify design and development of new applications and services, and integration and management of existing ones. But they offer other significant benefits to developers and organizations at large.</p>

        <h3>Types of APIs?</h3>
        <p><b>Open APIs </b> are open-source application programming interfaces you can access with the HTTP protocol. Also known as <b>public APIs,</b> they have defined API endpoints and request and response formats.</p>
        <p><b>Partner APIs </b> connect strategic business partners. Typically, developers access these APIs in self-service mode through a public API developer portal. Still, they need to complete an onboarding process and get login credentials to access partner APIs.</p>
        <p><b>Internal APIs </b> remain hidden from external users. These private APIs aren't available for users outside of the company and are instead intended to improve productivity and communication across different internal development teams.</p>
        <p><b>Composite APIs </b> combine multiple data or service APIs. They allow programmers to access several endpoints in a single call. Composite APIs are useful in microservices architecture where performing a single task may require information from several sources.
